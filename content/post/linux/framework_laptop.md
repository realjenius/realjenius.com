title: A Framework Laptop an Linux: Two Weeks In
draft: true
---
At the tail-end of 2021, I finally decided my *very* aging Macbook Pro was due to be replaced. The battery was worse than useless, the screen had dead-pixels, and it seemed to get heavier and slower as every day passed. I wanted a lightweight, high-performance, "ultra-book" style platform. I was just left with one choice in my mind: Macbook Air M1 or a Framework Modular Laptop. As the title implies, I decided to go bold, and support a company with a great vision [and some great supporters](). As a result, I now own a Framework, and because I hate Windows, I run Linux. Read on to learn my first experiences.

## Limping Along with Old Gear

I've worked from home for almost 12 years for over 5 companies. Consequently, I'm more anchored to my personal desktop computer than most people are these days. All that really means is that my Macbook Pro from 2015 has served me far better than most programmers with a laptop of that age.

For the heavyweight stuff I occasionally do, I could easily rely on my desktop machine. The MBP was totally fine mostly for "around the house" computing; frankly mostly web-browsing and some markdown authoring.

About two years ago, I decided to abandon Mac OS (mostly because they had started to abandon me), and installed [KDE Neon]() on the laptop. This worked oddly well for an Apple product, and sustained me for another 20 months or so.

Further, because of Covid, I don't travel for work nearly as much as I used to (read: at all, currently). As a result, my personal laptop is not a travel quality concern either most days. If it's heavier, bulkier, or less battery-friendly than I need, I barely notice at home.

However, increasingly, even I have become overwhelmed with the thousand paper-cuts of my current MBP:

* The battery was no longer sustaining life, health reports were abyssmal, and when it got low enough in percentage weird "glitches" would occur, I suspect from under-volting. Further, being a 2015 MBP, the battery replacement process, while possible, [is not exactly pleasant]().
* The screen had two dead pixels. Given how many pixels the first generations of Retina displays have, you wouldn't think this would be a huge issue, but those couple of black dots sure stick out like a sore thumb.
* As nice as the Linux support for older Macbooks actually is (I was surprised about how painless it turned out to be), the Wifi situation was always a little iffy, and seemed to have way too many "distance-based" drop-offs in performance and throughput.
* It was *heavy*. Given that might main use of a personal laptop is a little programming, mostly browsing, and some technical writing, the bulky MBP metal frame is a lot to get motivated to haul out and move about the house with.

All of this lead me to finally decide it was time to invest in a new portable around-the-house laptop that I could take on the occasional work-trip along with my work laptop, and not feel like I was hauling a brick through security.

This meant I was looking for a very capable, yet lightweight laptop that could do all the things I need, last a long time on a single charge, worked well without Windows (because Windows is a usability nightmare for programmers) and felt good to type on for long lengths at a time. And at this specific point in history, that's an interesting question in the laptop world.

## The M1: A Chip for the Future

I love Macbook Airs. I was an owner of the 1st-generation Air way back in 2011, and at the time I was traveling a lot for work. Having come from a whole litany of heavyweight Dells and other laptops, the Air weighed what felt like nothing (at least, at the time), and it "just worked" when I plugged it in to do presentations or demos for my job. Easily the best laptop I had experienced up to that point, aside from the fairly weak CPU.

As a result, as soon as I saw the early reports of the M1 Macbook Air, I was impulsively ready to get in line for one.

Apple has made a huge move for the future of their consumer electronics with their M-series of chips. I have zero doubt that the new ARM-based Mac processors will be a key element to reshaping the future of personal computing through Apple. The performance-per-watt metrics are incredibly impressive, but the intangible benefits of aligning the chip directly to the needs of the software manifests in a variety of subtle ways, as many operations common to Mac OS simply take less CPU instructions with the M1 than they might with the Intel; being unencumbered by the legacy of the Intel X86 history has a lot to do with this.

Of course, it is also Apple. I'm not particularly a fan of some of their anti-competitive walled-garden business practices, and I know full well if anything goes wrong with it, I'm fully at the mercy of Apple to decide how expensive it will be for me to get it fixed, including battery failures and otherwise.

But I also have used Mac OS products for my job for years, and fully practically understand how good their products are compared to most alternatives. So this option was on the table... even if I'd feel a bit dirty doing it.

## Linux: Actually Possible for Living

Of course, a lot has changed in the last 10 years since I got my first Macbook Air. At some point after 2010, I switched to Linux as my full-time personal OS. This was gradually possible for a variety of reasons:

1. The "web-first" mentality of companies like Google (read: Google Docs) has made Windows binaries far less critical to survive in the modern world (remember when you couldn't adult without MS Office?)
2. Gaming has become better on consoles, easier on the cloud (Stadia, Play Pass), and also to my surprise increasingly possible on Linux thanks to Steam OS and Proton.
3. Linux desktop environments, while in my opinion is still not great for the average human being, has slowly but surely made positive progress towards being not only usable, but pleasant, especially if you can be your own mechanic once in a while, which I certainly can
4. Flash all but died, and with it, proprietary hard-to-support platforms for Video. And while DRM is not exactly liked in the Linux community, it is at least largely supported thanks to Widevine](https://widevine.com), making Netflix, Youtube, Disney+, and most other video/streaming platforms "just work" in Linux.
5. Chrome took over the world, and brought Linux support with it, and Firefox has supported it non-stop as well
6. Microsoft, despite making tons of inroads for developers in the last few years, [has continued to flounder on their own OS](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/windows-11-the-ars-technica-review/)
7. Development of "all things" has only become more and more pleasant on Linux and less and less pleasant on Windows due to the convergence of a variety of factors, not the least of which most developers choosing Mac OS and terminal tooling, which is a lot closer to Linux than it is Windows, making tooling for Windows usually fall behind

## A Contender: The Framework Laptop

Then of course came along [Framework](https://frame.work). While Framework was certainly not the *first* modular laptop design, it has been the most compelling to me by a wide margin.

In general, [reviews](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/frameworks-new-lightweight-modular-laptop-delivers-on-its-promises/) [have been](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/framework-laptop-review-the-anti-macbook-has-arrived) [extremely positive](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/framework-laptop), touting the design, the build-quality, the customer experience, and the overall fit and finish. Additionally, the Framework is the very first laptop to [get a perfect 10 out of 10 from iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/News/51614/framework-laptop-teardown-10-10-but-is-it-perfect) for repairability.

And then, Linus, from Linus Tech Tips announced this past fall that he was officially investing in Framework, putting a significant tech juggernaut squarely in the startup's corner:

TODO youtube.

The Framework checks a lot of boxes for me: it's very light and thin, has a high-quality keyboard and screen, an official commitment to support Linux properly, and if the battery dies or I want more memory, a new hard-drive, or even a new CPU, I only need one type of bit, which they even provide if you don't already have one.

Even better, if I was "willing" (read: excited) to put the parts together myself, I could save $150 offs the base price.

## Taking the Leap

So, here I am writing this article from my Framework Laptop running [Manjaro KDE](https://manjaro.org/downloads/official/kde/), and the part of this article interesting to most: what has my experience been?

### The Good

The Framework laptop is definitely well built. The entire unpacking experience was exactly as advertised, and the DIY experience was definitely fun, though the WiFi antenna connectors were admittedly a little bit spooky to snap on.

Secure Boot is is always an issue

KDE does fractional scaling well, Intellij does not

Arch linux notes are great
Wifi kernel support is spooky
