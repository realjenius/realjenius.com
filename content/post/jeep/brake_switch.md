At the start of the year, my Jeep began reporting a failure in the traction control system, as well as eventually starting to throw a `P0571` check-engine ODB-II code. This post describes what I discovered as the root cause, and what could easily be your issue if you have had similar symptoms.

Over the course of the tail-end of 2020, I had noticed once in a very rare occasion that my Jeep's TCS failure light would turn on. This light is also sometimes colloquially known as "Car Snakes" because, perhaps unsurprisingly, it looks like a car being chased by snakes.

Note: Jeeps actually have two dash lights very similar to this: one that says "OFF", indicating that traction control is intentionally off, and another which doesn't have any words which indicates that the TCS system is off because the car's computer has detected an inconsistency and isn't confident it can safely enable TCS without causing other problems.

Traction control in Jeeps (and the huge majority of cars) works by selectively enabling the brakes automatically on individual wheels to attempt and restore control when it detects sliding or other traction issues occurring. To do this, two key things are needed by the onboard computer:

1. Wheel Speed Sensors: Wheel speed at all four corners so it can compare how fast the wheels are turning relative to each other, which can indicate slipping
2. Electronic Braking via ABS: The computer's ability to apply the brakes automatically via the ABS (antilock braking system)

As a result, if either of those systems are disrupted (or the computer is confused by what it is detecting), TCS will be disabled by the computer for safety reasons. Based on just that, we know that my issue with my periodic TCS failure light was *likely* related to wheel speed or brakes. At the time I was suspecting wheel speed sensors, as they can be impacted by a variety of external factors. But then my Jeep threw a check engine code: `P0571`.
