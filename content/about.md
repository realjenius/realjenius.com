Hello! My name is R.J. Lorimer, and I'm a professional software developer.

I am currently working for [Ultimate Software](http://ultimatesoftware.com).

### My History

Prior to working for Ultimate Software, I spent seven years immersed in the high-energy (and never boring) gaming industry, first working for Electrotank as *Director of Platform Engineering*, then working for Mind Pirate as the *Cloud Whisperer*, and most recently working for [High 5 Games](http://www.high5games.com) as their *Director of Server Development*.

Over the course of my career, I have technically lead a large variety of powerful teams.

Here’s a mini CV:

* I’ve been developing in Java, or otherwise on the JVM for 18 years.
* My expertise is in building high-concurrency, low-latency, fault-tolerant systems.
* Working in the games industry has given me unique experience in building low-latency systems at significant scale. This has given me valuable knowledge in low-level network, complex clustering problems, and large data management.
* The games industry also deals with tremendous amounts of data (hundreds of terabytes) all day long, so I have developed a lot of knowledge working with large scale database and distributed technologies.
* I have several years experience with Ruby, C#, Scala, Javascript, HTML, relational and non-relational database technologies.
* I have done a significant amount of editorial work over the years.
* I do all my own stunts.
